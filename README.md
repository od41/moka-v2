# Moka - Book club

Moka is a book club that connects readers and writers. It uses a bonding curve crowdfund model combined with easy publishing and reading UX to make writing and reading books more rewarding.



## Overview
It has 3 main components
1. Publishing: writers publish their work and fans pay to read.

2. Reading: purchase books from the store and enjoy a pleasant reading experience with your fellow book lovers.

3. Crowdfunding: fans and investors fund writers that they love on Moka. Funding isn't only for the love of the art, it's also a way to make money. By funding you receive a token early which grants you a share of the book subs revenue when they're published.
